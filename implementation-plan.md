   - Set up Black, isort, and Ruff for backend
   - Add configuration files to repository

3. **Improve test structure**
   - Organize test directories according to the testing strategy
   - Create shared test fixtures
   - Document testing approach

## Phase 2: CI/CD Improvements (Week 2)

1. **Enhance CI workflows**

   - Configure test coverage reporting
   - Set up branch protection rules

2. **Set up staging environment**
   - Create AWS resources for staging
   - Configure environment variables
   - Set up database for staging

3. **Implement deployment pipeline for staging**
   - Create deployment workflow for backend
   - Create deployment workflow for frontend
   - Test end-to-end deployment

## Phase 3: Production Setup (Week 3)

1. **Set up production environment**
   - Create AWS resources for production
   - Configure environment variables
   - Set up database for production

2. **Implement deployment pipeline for production**

## Phase 4: Documentation and Training (Week 4)

1. **Document infrastructure**
   - Create architecture diagrams
   - Document deployment process
   - Create runbooks for common tasks

2. **Document development workflow**
   - Create contributing guidelines

## Success Criteria

1. **Pre-commit hooks** catch issues before they reach CI
2. **Code quality** metrics show improvement over time
3. **Test coverage** reaches target levels
4. **Deployment pipeline** is reliable and fast
5. **Monitoring** provides early warning of issues
6. **Documentation** is comprehensive and up-to-date
7. **Team members** are comfortable with the new workflow
